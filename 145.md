I hope this is helpful!

User:
Take that same line chart and add the temperatures for New Delhi and Mumbai to it in the same period. New Delhi should be green and Mumbai should be red. Add a y-axis grid as well and show your code.

Model:
Sure, here is the code to generate the images:

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read CSV

df = pd.read_csv("Indian Summers.csv")

# Convert the 'Date' column to datetime format

df["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Date"])

# Extract year and month from the 'Date' column

df["Year"] = df["Date"].dt.year
df["Month"] = df["Date"].dt.month

# Define a function to filter data for the given city

def filter_city_data(city_name):
return df[
(df["City"] == city_name)
& (df["Year"] == 2010)
& (df["Month"] >= 4)
& (df["Month"] <= 5)
][["Date", "tempmax"]]

jaipurSummer = filter_city_data("Jaipur")
delhiSummer = filter_city_data("New Delhi")
mumbaiSummer = filter_city_data("Mumbai")

# Create a line graph for each city

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(jaipurSummer["Date"], jaipurSummer["tempmax"], label="Jaipur")
plt.plot(delhiSummer["Date"], delhiSummer["tempmax"], color="green", label="New Delhi")
plt.plot(mumbaiSummer["Date"], mumbaiSummer["tempmax"], color="red", label="Mumbai")

# Add y-axis grid

plt.grid(axis="y", alpha=0.5, linestyle="--")

# Add title, labels, legend and grid

plt.title("Max Temperature between April and May in 2010")
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Temperature")
plt.legend()

plt.tight_layout()

# Show plot

plt.show()
This code creates the image:

I hope this is helpful!

User:
Add a shaded area above 37 degrees Celsius that progressively intensifies in red color, indicating increasing levels of extreme heat.

User:
In which city and on what date was the record highest temperature recorded?

Model:
Sure, the highest maximum temperature was 49.1°C on June 9th, 2007 in New Delhi.
I hope this is helpful!

User:
What was that in Fahrenheit?

Input File: Indian Summers.csv
Golden Answer:
The maximum temperature was 120.4 degrees Fahrenheit.

Model Response A:
CODE:

import pandas as pd

# Read CSV

df = pd.read_csv("Indian Summers.csv")

# Convert the 'Date' column to datetime format

df["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Date"])

# Find the highest maximum temperature

max_temp = df["tempmax"].max()

# Determine on what day it was

max_temp_day = df[df["tempmax"] == max_temp]["Date"].values[0]

# Determine which city

max_temp_city = df[df["tempmax"] == max_temp]["City"].values[0]

# Convert temp to fahrenheit

max_temp_fahrenheit = (max_temp \* 9) / 5 + 32

print(
"The highest maximum temperature was {}°C on {} in {}. This is equal to {}°F.".format(
max_temp, max_temp_day, max_temp_city, max_temp_fahrenheit
)
)

RESULT:
The highest maximum temperature was 49.1°C on 2007-06-09T00:00:00.000000000 in New Delhi. This is equal to 120.38000000000001°F.

Model Response B:
The highest maximum temperature was 49.1°C on 2007-06-09T00:00:00.000000000 in New Delhi. This is equal to 120.38°F.
