Can you give me the top 20 largest animals including their weights

Model:

Here is a list of the top 20 largest animals on Earth by weight, including their estimated weights in metric tons:

Rank Animal Weight (metric tons)
1 Blue whale 180
2 Fin whale 120
3 Bowhead whale 120
4 North Pacific right whale 120
5 North Atlantic right whale 110
6 Southern right whale 110
7 Sperm whale 57
8 Humpback whale 48
9 Sei whale 45
10 Gray whale 45
11 African elephant 6
12 Asian elephant 5
13 Hippopotamus 4.5
14 White rhinoceros 4.5
15 Indian rhinoceros 4
16 Black rhinoceros 2.9
17 Javan rhinoceros 2.3
18 Giraffe 2
19 Bison 1.8
20 Kodiak bear 1.5
Note: This list is based on estimated average weights. Actual weights can vary depending on the individual animal.

It is also important to note that the largest animal ever to have lived was the extinct whale Perucetus, which is estimated to have weighed up to 340 metric tons.

User:
Could you create a bar chart showing the most weights of these animals, with every animal represented on the y-axis and their weights at the x-axis?

Model:
Here’s the code to generate the bar chart:
[PLOT]
I hope it helps!

User:
Could you please make the following modification to the chart: Change the color of the bars to green and add labels to both the y-axis (Animal) and x-axis (Weight in tons) for better clarity?

Model:
The Python code to create a bar chart displaying the maximum weights of various animals. This code uses the Matplotlib library to generate the chart. Here’s the Python code to create the modified bar chart.

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

animals = [
"Blue whale", "Fin whale", "Sperm whale", "Sei whale", "Bowhead whale",
"Northern Pacific right whale", "North Atlantic right whale",
"Southern right whale", "Bryde's whale", "Humpback whale",
"African bush elephant", "Asian elephant", "African forest elephant",
"White rhinoceros", "Hippopotamus", "Giraffe", "Kodiak bear",
"Polar bear", "Southern elephant seal", "American bison"
]
weights = [
190, 100, 90, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 40, 40, 10.4, 8.15, 6.0, 4.5, 3.2, 1.2, 0.68, 0.68, 0.67, 0.64
]

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.barh(animals, weights, color='green')
plt.xlabel('Weight in tons')
plt.ylabel('Animal')
plt.title('Maximum Weights of Animals')
plt.gca().invert_yaxis()  
plt.show()
[PLOT]

User:
Can you calculate the average weight of these animals?

Model:
Sure! The average weight of these animals is 36.06
I hope this is helpful. Can I help you with anything else?

User:
Can you create a line chart based on the information?

Model:
Sure! Here is the line plot:
[PLOT]
I hope it helps!

User:
Can you provide the last 10 animals on this list?

Input File:
Golden Answer:
The last 10 animals in the dataframe:
African bush elephant
Asian elephant
African forest elephant
White rhinoceros
Hippopotamus
Giraffe
Kodiak bear
Polar bear
Southern elephant seal
American bison

Model Response A:
CODE:

```python
# Import libraries

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

animals = [
"Blue whale", "Fin whale", "Sperm whale", "Sei whale", "Bowhead whale",
"Northern Pacific right whale", "North Atlantic right whale", "Southern right whale",
"Bryde's whale", "Humpback whale", "African bush elephant", "Asian elephant",
"African forest elephant", "White rhinoceros", "Hippopotamus", "Giraffe",
"Kodiak bear", "Polar bear", "Southern elephant seal", "American bison"
]

weights = [
190, 100, 90, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 40, 40, 10.4, 8.15, 6.0, 4.5, 3.2, 1.2, 0.68, 0.68, 0.67, 0.64
]

# Load data in a pandas dataframe

df= pd.DataFrame()
df['animals'] = animals
df['weights'] = weights

# Last 10 animals

last_10_animals = df['animals'].tail(10)

# Print the last 10 animals

print(last_10_animals.to_string(index=False))
```

RESULT:
African bush elephant
Asian elephant
African forest elephant
White rhinoceros
Hippopotamus
Giraffe
Kodiak bear
Polar bear
Southern elephant seal
American bison

Model Response B:
Sure! Here is the last 10 animals on this list:

Animal
African bush elephant
Asian elephant
African forest elephant
White rhinoceros
Hippopotamus
Giraffe
Kodiak bear
Polar bear
Southern elephant seal
American bison
I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other requests.
