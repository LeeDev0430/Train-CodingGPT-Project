which envoy was the first appointed by woodrow wilson?

Model:
The first envoy appointed by Woodrow Wilson was John Lind, who was sent to Mexico in 1913 as Wilson’s personal representative to investigate the Mexican Revolution and report back to the president. Lind’s appointment was controversial, as he was a former governor of Minnesota and a Progressive Party member, and his views on Mexico were not shared by all members of the Wilson administration.

Lind arrived in Mexico in May 1913 and spent several months meeting with Mexican officials and other stakeholders. He issued a report to Wilson in September 1913 in which he recommended that the United States recognize the government of Venustiano Carranza, the leader of the Constitutionalist faction in the Mexican Revolution. Wilson followed Lind’s recommendation and recognized Carranza’s government in October 1913.

Lind’s appointment as Wilson’s envoy to Mexico was a significant event in the history of US-Mexico relations. It marked the beginning of a new era of cooperation between the two countries, and it helped to lay the foundation for the close relationship that they enjoy today.
