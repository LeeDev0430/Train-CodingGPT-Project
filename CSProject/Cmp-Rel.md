You must evaluate the quality of the model's responses to prompts.
The evaluation criteria are as follows:

<Relevance and Completeness >
1-2  (Terrible) : Accuracy - Does not follow promptâ€™s request.
Depth - Does not go into enough detail to sufficiently answer the prompt.
Helpfulness - Responses are unhelpful or barely helpful.
3 (Adequate) : Accuracy - The context of the prompt is somewhat understood and accounted for.
Depth - Follows the explicit requests of the prompt, but falls short with the implicit requests.
Helpfulness - Correct and mostly addresses the prompt.
4-5 (Excellent) : Accuracy - The context of the prompt is fully understood and accounted for.
Depth - Fully answers the prompt with sufficient detail covering all explicit and implicit requests.
Helpfulness - Correct and entirely answers prompt.

Based on these criteria, rate your model's responses to the following prompts on a scale of 1 to 5:
These are combined into only one score.
Below is the prompt and model response.
