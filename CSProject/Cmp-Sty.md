You must evaluate the quality of the model's responses to prompts.
The evaluation criteria are as follows:

<Code Readability>
1-2  (Terrible) : Formatting - Formatting makes code difficult to read.
Naming - Variable and function names make understanding code more difficult.
3 (Adequate) : Formatting - Minor inconsistencies.
Naming - Variable and function names are clear and concise.
4-5 (Excellent) : Formatting - Perfect formatting that is neat and utilizes white-space effectively.
Naming - Variables and function names make understanding of code easier.

<Conciseness>
1-2  (Terrible) : Repetition - The response communicates the exact same ideas, but potentially in slightly different ways, multiple times within the response. The repetition is not used for stylistic effect
Length - The response is overly verbose, and/or significantly exceeds the the word limits directly imposed by the prompt
Verbosity - Reponses with poor conciseness take multiple sentences to explain concepts that are possible within a sentence or two.
3 (Adequate) : Repetition - The response communicates the exact same ideas, but in slightly different ways multiple times within the response. The repetition is not used for stylistic effect
Length - The response is close to the length specified explicitly by the prompt
Verbosity - Response explains most of its concepts or points efficiently, but still may have some overly verbose sentences or claims
4-5 (Excellent) : Repetition - Response does not unnecessarily repeat information, implicitly or explicitly, unless as a  stylistic device to emphasize certain key points
Length - The response fits the length specified explicitly by the prompt
Verbosity - Response efficiently communicates its concepts and points consistently. Concise responses can still be long, if all of the added content adds discrete value in furtherance of the core claims of the response.

<Formatting & Coherence>
1-2 (Terrible) : Visual Presentation - There is no visual separation between ideas; Distinct ideas are lumped together in one paragraph
Text Formatting - Lists are not broken into bullet points; Markdown is broken.
Outline and Coherence - The ideas covered in the response are not outlined /or presented in a logical order. Each paragraph jumps from idea to idea with no logical transition
3 (Adequate) : Visual Presentation - The ideas covered in the response are visually separated into distinct text space
Text Formatting - Lists are used when appropriate, including bolding where relevant. Markdown renders appropriately. Key detail may not be bolded
Outline and Coherence - The ideas covered in the response are outlined, but the transition between paragraphs and ideas could be improved
4-5 (Excellent) : Visual Presentation - The ideas covered in the response are visually separated into distinct text spaces. Whitespace is used intentionally with added effect.
Text Formatting - Lists are used when appropriately, including bolding where relevant. Markdown renders appropriately.
Outline and Coherence - ideas are introduced and outlined to the reader appropriately, and ideas seamlessly transition from one to another

<Code Design & Implementation>
1-2 (Terrible) : Code is ambiguous, unorganized and it’s really unclear what each line does. The structure could be improved.
3 (Adequate) : Code is messy and it’s not immediately obvious what it does but eventually it can be understood.
4-5 (Excellent) : Code is nicely de-composed and divided in functions that are intelligible and that make sense. The code reads nicely.

<Verbosity>
1-2  (Terrible) : Response and prompt feature plenty of verbosity, redundancy and unnecessary filler content.
3 (Adequate) : Response and prompt features some verbosity, redundancy or unnecessary filler content but the task remains of good quality.
4-5 (Excellent) : Response and prompt avoid verbosity, redundancy and unnecessary filler content.

Based on these criteria, rate your model's responses to the following prompts on a scale of 1 to 5.
Sum it up and evaluate it as only one score.
