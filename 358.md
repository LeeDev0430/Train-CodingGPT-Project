Plot the distribution of JobSatisfaction. Assign an appropriate chart title, as well as axis labels. Show the code used to produce this plot.

Model:
Sure, here is the code to generate the images:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# read the input data

df = pd.read_csv("watson_healthcare_modified.csv")

# extract the bins and counts to be used in the histogram

bins = df['JobSatisfaction'].astype(str).value_counts().sort_index().index
counts = df['JobSatisfaction'].astype(str).value_counts().sort_index().values

# plot the histogram and assign a chart title, as well as axis labels

plt.bar(bins, counts)
plt.title('Number of Occurrences for JobSatisfaction')
plt.ylabel('Number of Occurrences')
plt.xlabel("Job Satisfaction Score")
This code creates the image:

[Image of JobSatisfaction histogram]

How many employees have been in their current role for at least 3 years, as a percentage of all employees? Show the code used to get this answer and round it to two decimal places.

Model:
Sure, here is the code to calculate the percentage of employees who have been in their current role for at least 3 years, rounded to two decimal places:

import pandas as pd

# read the input data

df = pd.read_csv("watson_healthcare_modified.csv")

# divide the length of the desired subset of employees over the length of the entire dataset and print the result, rounded to two decimal places

print(
round(len(df[df.YearsInCurrentRole >= 3]) / len(df) \* 100, 2),
"% of employees have been in their current role for at least 3 years.",
)

I hope this is helpful!
