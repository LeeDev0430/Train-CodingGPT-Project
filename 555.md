What department has the highest job satisfaction and how far above the average job satisfaction is that department? Provide the full Python code.

Input File: watson_healthcare_modified.csv
Golden Answer:
The Neurology department has the highest job satisfaction, which is 0.02 points above the overall average.

Model Response A:
CODE:

import pandas as pd

# Read CSV

df = pd.read_csv("watson_healthcare_modified.csv")

# Drop duplicates

df_unique = df.drop_duplicates()

# Group by Department

dept_grouped = df_unique.groupby("Department")

# Mean Job Satisfaction

mean_job_satisfaction_by_dept = dept_grouped["JobSatisfaction"].mean()

# Max average job satisfaction

highest_avg_job_satisfaction_dept = mean_job_satisfaction_by_dept.idxmax()
highest_avg_job_satisfaction = mean_job_satisfaction_by_dept.max()

# Average Job Satisfaction

avg_job_satisfaction = mean_job_satisfaction_by_dept.mean()

# Difference from average

difference_from_average = highest_avg_job_satisfaction - avg_job_satisfaction

print(
f"The department with the highest job satisfaction is {highest_avg_job_satisfaction_dept} with an average job satisfaction of {highest_avg_job_satisfaction:.2f}, which is {difference_from_average:.2f} above the average job satisfaction."
)

RESULT:
The department with the highest job satisfaction is Neurology with an average job satisfaction of 2.76, which is 0.02 above the average job satisfaction.

Model Response B:
Sure, here is the code:

import pandas as pd

# Read CSV

df = pd.read_csv("watson_healthcare_modified.csv")

# Drop duplicates

df_unique = df.drop_duplicates()

# Group by Department

dept_grouped = df_unique.groupby("Department")

# Mean Job Satisfaction

mean_job_satisfaction_by_dept = dept_grouped["JobSatisfaction"].mean()

# Max average job satisfaction

highest_avg_job_satisfaction_dept = mean_job_satisfaction_by_dept.idxmax()
highest_avg_job_satisfaction = mean_job_satisfaction_by_dept.max()

# Average Job Satisfaction

avg_job_satisfaction = mean_job_satisfaction_by_dept.mean()

# Difference from average

difference_from_average = highest_avg_job_satisfaction - avg_job_satisfaction

print(
f"The department with the highest job satisfaction is {highest_avg_job_satisfaction_dept} with an average job satisfaction of {highest_avg_job_satisfaction:.2f}, which is {difference_from_average:.2f} above the average job satisfaction."
)

This code outputs the following:

The department with the highest job satisfaction is Neurology with an average job satisfaction of 2.76, which is 0.02 above the average job satisfaction.
